        <p id="bio">Matt was born in Varginha, Brazil, but he has spent 18 years of 
            his life living here in Utah. From a young age, Matt has been passionate 
        about video games, computers, and potential technologies of the future. He is
    inspired by the field of computer programming because he believes it is the only 
profession where individuals are completely in control of their personal successes. His
goal is to eventually own and operate a software company specializing in various media 
services, with an emphasis on gaming. </p>
